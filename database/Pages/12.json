Alphanumeric characters are represented using binary bits (i.e., 0 and 1). Digital representations are easier to design, storage is easy, accuracy and precision are greater.</p><p>There are various types of number representation techniques for digital number representation, for example: Binary number system, <a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/octal-number-system\" target=\"_blank\">octal number system</a>, <a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/decimal-number-system\" target=\"_blank\">decimal number system</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/hexadecimal-number-system\" target=\"_blank\">hexadecimal number system</a> etc. But Binary number system is most relevant and popular for representing numbers in digital computer system.</p><h2 style=\"\">Storing Real Number</h2><p style=\"\">These are structures as following below −</p><p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assets/questions/media/18154/36_1.jpg\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" style=\"width:434px;height:334px;\" width=\"434\" height=\"334\"></p><p>There are two major approaches to store real numbers (i.e., numbers with fractional component) in modern computing. These are (i) Fixed Point Notation and (ii) Floating Point Notation. In fixed point notation, there are a fixed number of digits after the decimal point, whereas floating point number allows for a varying number of digits after the decimal point.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>&nbsp;Fixed-Point Representation −</strong></p><p>This representation has fixed number of bits for integer part and for fractional part. For example, if given fixed-point representation is IIII.FFFF, then you can store minimum value is 0000.0001 and maximum value is 9999.9999. There are three parts of a fixed-point number representation: the sign field, integer field, and fractional field.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assets/questions/media/18154/36_2.jpg\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" style=\"width:384px;height:83px;\" width=\"384\" height=\"83\"></p><p>We can represent these numbers using:</p><ul class=\"list\"><li>Signed representation: range from -(2<sup>(k-1)</sup>-1) to (2<sup>(k-1)</sup>-1), for k bits.</li><li>1’s complement representation: range from -(2<sup>(k-1)</sup>-1) to (2<sup>(k-1)</sup>-1), for k bits.</li><li>2’s complementation representation: range from -(2<sup>(k-1)</sup>) to (2<sup>(k-1)</sup>-1), for k bits.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/two-s-complement\" target=\"_blank\">2’s complementation</a> representation is preferred in computer system because of unambiguous property and easier for arithmetic operations.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>Example −</strong>Assume number is using 32-bit format which reserve 1 bit for the sign, 15 bits for the integer part and 16 bits for the fractional part.</p><p>Then, -43.625 is represented as following:</p><p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assets/questions/media/18154/36_3.jpg\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" style=\"width:367px;height:81px;\" width=\"367\" height=\"81\"></p><p>Where, 0 is used to represent + and 1 is used to represent. 000000000101011 is 15 bit binary value for decimal 43 and 1010000000000000 is 16 bit binary value for fractional 0.625.</p><p>The advantage of using a <a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/fixed-point-and-floating-point-number-representations\" target=\"_blank\">fixed-point representation</a> is performance and disadvantage is &nbsp;relatively limited range of values that they can represent. So, it is usually inadequate for numerical analysis as it does not allow enough numbers and accuracy. A number whose representation exceeds 32 bits would have to be stored inexactly.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assets/questions/media/18154/36_4.jpg\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" style=\"width:467px;height:163px;\" width=\"467\" height=\"163\"></p><p>These are above smallest positive number and largest positive number which can be store in 32-bit representation as given above format.

Instead it reserves a certain number of bits for the number (called the mantissa or significand) and a certain number of bits to say where within that number the decimal place sits (called the exponent).</p><p>The floating number representation of a number has two part: the first part represents a signed fixed point number called mantissa. The second part of designates the position of the decimal (or binary) point and is called the exponent. The fixed point mantissa may be fraction or an integer. Floating -point is always interpreted to represent a number in the following form: Mxr<sup>e</sup>.</p><p>Only the mantissa m and the exponent e are physically represented in the register (including their sign). A floating-point binary number is represented in a similar manner except that is uses base 2 for the exponent. A floating-point number is said to be normalized if the most significant digit of the mantissa is 1.</p><p><img src=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assets/questions/media/18154/36_5.jpg\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\" style=\"width:398px;height:119px;\" width=\"398\" height=\"119\"></p><p>So, actual number is (-1)<sup>s</sup>(1+m)x2<sup>(e-Bias)</sup>, where <em>s&nbsp;</em>is the sign bit, <em>m&nbsp;</em>is the mantissa, <em>e&nbsp;</em>is the exponent value, and <em>Bias&nbsp;</em>is the bias number.</p><p>Note that signed integers and exponent are represented by either sign representation, or one’s complement representation, or two’s complement representation.</p><p>The floating point representation is more flexible. Any non-zero number can be represented in the normalized form of &nbsp;±(1.b<sub>1</sub>b<sub>2</sub>b<sub>3</sub> ...)<sub>2</sub>x2<sup>n</sup> This is normalized form of a number x.</p><p style=\"\"><strong>Example −</strong>Suppose number is using 32-bit format: the 1 bit sign bit, 8 bits for signed exponent, and 23 bits for the fractional part.
