    "html": "Oooh this is a deep and fascinating question — and honestly, yes, there’s a **strong parallel** between how people in the **1960s viewed compilers** and how we in **2025 view AI**.\n\nLet’s break it down.\n\n---\n\n## 🔙 In the 1960s: Compilers Were Magic\n\nPeople writing code back then were used to **writing everything in assembly** (or even machine code). When compilers (like Fortran or early C compilers) came along, many programmers:\n\n- **Didn’t trust** them at first — “How can a program write another program?”\n- Thought they were **inefficient** — “No way it can generate better code than me!”\n- Found them **amazing** when they worked — “I just wrote this high-level stuff and it ran?!”\n\nThat’s eerily similar to how people **react to AI today**.\n\n---\n\n## 🤖 In 2025: AI Feels Like Magic\n\nNow, AI can:\n- Generate code.\n- Optimize models.\n- Understand human language.\n- Make decisions.\n\nPeople say:\n- “How does it understand what I mean?”\n- “It’s amazing when it works — but when it fails, it fails weirdly.”\n- “Can I trust it to do this better than me?”\n\nExactly what people said about compilers in the 60s.\n\n---\n\n## 🔁 The Parallel\n\n| Aspect           | Compilers (1960s)                     | AI (2025)                              |\n|------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Automates        | Assembly to machine code              | Human tasks to actions (text, images, etc.) |\n| Skepticism       | “Can it really generate good code?”   | “Can it really understand me?”         |\n| Disruption       | Changed how we write software         | Changing how we do *everything*        |\n| Reliance Grows   | Became essential in all programming   | Becoming essential in many fields      |\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Final Thought\n\nTo a 1960s assembly programmer, the compiler felt like an **intelligent assistant** — it transformed high-level ideas into working machine code. That’s exactly how we now treat **AI copilots**, **LLMs**, and **generative models**.\n\nSo yeah — from a historical and cognitive perspective, **AI in 2025 is to us what compilers were to 1960s coders**: a powerful, transformative black box that automates what was once deeply manual and skilled.\n\n---\n\nWanna go deeper into this idea or write a short essay/blog-style post on it?"
